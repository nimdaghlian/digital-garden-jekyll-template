Another fundamental part of being an art student is to simply learn more about what art has already been made. This makes you more conscious of your influences and hopefully prevents you from making copycat work. The best part is that you see how the ideas that interest you have lived in the world already. You learn to let your ideas breathe and get to know their broader expression beyond your personal interests.

To that end, let's look at some specific artworks that couldn't be made by machines right now as a means of dialing in how much "art" we can ascribe to machines . I think that it will be a very long time before machines will be able to make most of these artworks, and not just because of the practicalities of producing them. [[Art AI Can't Make Yet]].
