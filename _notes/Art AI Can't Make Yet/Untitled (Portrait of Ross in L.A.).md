### “Untitled” (Portrait of Ross in L.A.) by Felix Gonzales Torres

While Torres [did not intend](https://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/museums/ct-ent-art-institute-gonzalez-torres-ross-description-20221006-lerg7ym6ibalbbjncm2su5tg7i-story.html) for this or any of his other candy pieces to be read as straightforward symbolic representations of an individual or an idea, we're going to focus on the [most broadly circulated interpretation](https://twitter.com/MariaWNorris/status/1466088500013547533) of this piece. "Ross" was Torres's boyfriend when he died of AIDS in 1991, shortly before Torres made this piece. Though Torres left many parameters of this piece in the hands of the galleries that showed it (such as whether or not to replenish the candy after visitors took pieces), he specified that it begin at 175 pounds -- Ross's weight when he was healthy, in the popular interpretation. The act of taking the candy diminishes the pile, as Ross was diminished, but it also distributes literal sweetness.

There's an object in France that is used to define a kilogram. Every idea of a kilogram is a shadow of that canonical object. Sometimes I feel like this piece does that for a certain feeling that wells in the throat when thinking of losing, or having lost, loved ones.

Almost every practical quality of this art work is loosely definied and untouched by the artist's hand. This specific, famous artwork is not recognized by the type of candy that comprises it, how it is displayed, or the rules for what to do when people take the candy. At this point, Torres's authorship is confined to what is essentially a prompt, closer to the conceptual art of [Yoko Ono's Grapefruit] than a physical sculpture.

And yet we recognize it by a specific, highly emotional texture it has contributed to what we call "art." The thing that Torres made is real, it exists mainly in the viewer, and by all accounts he made very specific formal and conceptual choices to place it there.

Now, or soon, image and text generators could make or instruct people, on their own, to make everything about this piece *except* that part. Computers can't make this piece because they do not have boyfriends who can fall ill and die. The gulf between this piece and what they can do now is the gulf between AGI and whatever it is we have now.
