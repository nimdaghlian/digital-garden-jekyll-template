#sprout #draft 

- you have to consistently show up
- sure it's poisoning portfolio submissions, but the system is adapted to that.
	- you still have to distinguish yourself from the other submissions
	- you still have to be able to talk about your work in a [[Two ways to talk about art | useful]] way
	- of course this only applies to non-bullshit programs, not diploma mills
