Hi! Like all of you, we've been trying to walk the weird tightrope (slackline?) of hanging out with our beloved friends and trying not to get or give Covid. I thought it would be useful to actually write out our approach so you know where we're at:

**I'd put our level of caution at slightly-higher-than-average.** 

We have a few friends who've been hit really hard by Covid, and out of respect for them I can't really pretend this is all over.

**What's that mean?**

That means:

* we're vaxxed and boosted, of course
* we've been going out less than we would normally, and avoiding higher-risk stuff
* we mask in any semi-crowded to crowded spot
* we've been testing regularly, whether or not we feel sick
* we've been testing before any group event
* we have tests to share if anyone needs one
* we have two (kind of expensive) PCR tests available for a super-dooper-need-to-know-now situation
* we've been trying to do more controlled group hangs -- either hosting them ourselves, or picking spots that we can have a private or semi-private room
* we run an airfilter (for what that's worth) when we have people over
* **if you have special concerns, or would prefer that we mask, we are *super* willing to accomodate.**
