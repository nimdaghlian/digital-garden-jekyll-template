This list is just a sampling of the many directions that we can go with art that remain beyond the reach of digital images that are produced by machines. If you're trying to go in any of those directions with art, image generators won't really be more useful to you than other ways of producing images. The best they can offer is speed, but should we really be that excited about getting to [the end of the pier faster](XXXX) when what we need is a bridge? 

Of course, if you insist on using them, you can always bullshit. This is a time-honored tradition in art: obscure your work with a cloud of words cajoling the viewer into thinking what you want them to, or at least thinking within the frame of your choice. I just hope that my enticement to Do Theory will discourage that a little, or help others cut through or ignore such lexical fogs.

That said, I don't mean to underestimate the current or future impact of machine generated products on the practice and viewing of art. If anything, these examples are a way of taking it seriously. If we expect the machines to only get better or more sophisticated, here are some measures for them to aim for.
