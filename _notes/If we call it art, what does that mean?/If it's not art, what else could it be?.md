## If it's not Art, what else could it be?




In many ways, even discussing the output of image generators in the context of art is accepting the frame boosted by [those who stand to benefit] from the energy that people put into making and talking about art. 

As artists, we don't have to even let them in the door -- many are not. Hito Steryl refers to them as "statistical generations", and considers the use of ready-made statistical generations as art "foreclosed" to contemporary artists already. [ref needed]

If we ask how this output fits into the world, most of the time the answer is as a [product]. Something that exists primarily to be traded, transmitted, produced, and transacted. 

The most fitting term I can think of for this output is "opifact".

"Opifact" was a term [coined in by Roger Fry](https://www.jstor.org/stable/41810652) to refer to something that behaves like art in the market but lacks -- or is indifferent to -- any qualities that would give it the label of "art." 

I discovered this term while working on my dissertation in art school, around the same time that I learned about Allan McCollum's [surrogates](https://art21.org/watch/extended-play/allan-mccollum-surrogate-paintings-plaster-surrogates-short/). Both ideas propose a sort of art-algebra problem that sidesteps the need to rigorously define what art is; assign *x* to art, factor it out, and see if your formula for *not-art* gives you results that feel like what you're looking at. 

Of course there's no formula for art-or-not-art, but the idea of a not-art-art-object -- an opifact -- is a really useful operator when you're working with the hunches, reactions, and impressions that are what most people use in searching for their own definition and experience of art. In these conversations where "art" remains an uneasy term, we could reliably use *opifact* until some further date when we have sorted out how to talk about this new category of visual phenomena.
