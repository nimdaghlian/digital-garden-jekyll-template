### Is it art, though?


**Yes, of course it is.** 

Humans can choose to engage with image generators and what they produce like how they engage with art. We can look at it, enjoy it, think about it, frame it, give it awards, put it in museums, print it out and burn it.

**No, of course it is not.**

No medium guarantees that, in using it, you have made art. Not marble, not even oil paint. Furthermore, this medium lacks many significant dimensions required to engage with it in many ways that we currently engage with art. For an incomplete list, see [[Art AI Can't Make Yet]], and note the [[Speedbumps]] on the way.

This is what every thinkpiece that asks this question should be limited to saying.
