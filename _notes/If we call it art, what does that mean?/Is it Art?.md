### Is it art?

What does this question even mean? We can point it at the outside world -- should we welcome these images into the same cultural spaces that we reserve for existing art, and should we encounter and value them on the same terms? Should they be included in competitions, museums, art schools, artist communities, advertising, and our homes? Does any of that make it art? Certainly not if you're in the business of looking for intrinsic qualities of artfulness to judge things by.

We can also point this question inward -- should we spend the time we reserve for making, thinking, and enjoying art on these new images and tools for making them? Should we look to them for the same things we look for in existing art? Can we find them there, and if we do are we fooling ourselves? Are we being fooled, or do these qualities reside within the AI like a stone in a forest?
