### But is it art, though.

If we're going to ask this, we have to really expand the frame in which we talk about "AI Art." This question is too poorly defined to be useful. Here are some better questions inside that question.

This is a potentially infinite well. 
* What art things can't it do?
* If it's not art, what else could it be?
* If we decide to call it art, what does "art" mean to us?
* What genuinely new art things could it do?
