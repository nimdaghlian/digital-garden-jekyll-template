### What is it then?

Instead of asking if this new kind of image "is Art," we need to ask "what is this new thing we are looking at?" and try to really, really see it.

Of course, not all machine-generated images come from the same source or manifest in the same way. Conversely, not all of our concerns about machine-generated art are confined to the realm of images. So, before we proceed, let's come up with a working definition.

When I talk about machine-images, I'm specifically referring to images produced by prompted generators or images produced by any chain of technologies that includes a text-to-image step or even an image-as-prompt. We can generalize and say that we are talking about machine-led processes that can use instructive rather than constructive imput to make images. **Ie the lasso tool in Photoshop is constructive in the sense that  you must draw the boundaries of an area for the machine to process, whereas "remove sky" is an instruction to the machine to do its own thing.**

At the time of writing, this seems to cover the contemporary focus on generated images. We could have an interesting time bending these boundaries to include the [previous generations](https://www.amygoodchild.com/blog/computer-art-50s-and-60s) of  images generated purely by code, math, algorithms, random walks, mechanical devices, trees, visualized data, etc. They are certainly not irrelevant to the ideas we're working with, but they are not as much in the zeitgeist, and this essay has to end at some point, so we'll keep our attention on the current generation of machine-images.

We will be talking about visual art, but these technologies have been applied to music and of course writing. Likewise, the non-specific term of "art," when I use it, isn't confined by basic differences in medium. [more on that fucker] So, while we are focusing on images, I will try to talk about them in a way that is `usable` beyond the realm of images, and not restrict myself to sources in the visual arts.
