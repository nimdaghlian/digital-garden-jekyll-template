### Intro

* It's not actually a problem to redefine art, or to work with multiple definitions of it
* here's a handy book that leads to a handy theory about all that
* We're back at usable vs self-contained
	* Wiescz gives us a `usable` definition of art
	* departure point that lets us keep asking questions
	* kitchen vs restaurant << check prev LTAP work
* Fixed definitions of art are `self-contained` and must defend their positions against art that takes different forms
* So, if we are intersted in `usable` theories of art, do algogens tend towards an open or closed definition of art?
