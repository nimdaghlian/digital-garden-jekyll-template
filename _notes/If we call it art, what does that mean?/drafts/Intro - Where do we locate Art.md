## Where do we locate art

- What does this mean
	- It means, given all the aspects of how the art fits into the world, which ones do we say are part of what makes it art? This includes
		- how it is made
		- what it is made out of
		- who made it
		- why they made it
		- how long it took to make
		- what it looks like
		- how and where it can be experienced
		- what it means
		- what it includes
		- what it excludes
		- what it is called
		- how it is used or sold

> tie back to the machine vs human + machine distinction. Being aware of where we locate art means understanding what is actually coming from the machine and what is actually coming from the human, mediated but not actively "artified" by the machine
