<![CDATA[<p>hiiiiii! time for more art. this edition of the grapefruits sometimes art mail is kind of just a bunch of stuff i like... i guess the rough through line is representational images in 2 dimensions... aka paintings/drawings/prints of people, places, and things! also i just felt like collecting a lot of beautiful pictures to look at, which is why i got into making art in the first place â€“ maybe you can relate?</p>

<p>this is a bit different for me, but yolo... i am starting with <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CZzw_SEs-JR/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">an instagram post</a> by the artist avocado ibubrofen (real name jaako pallasvuo, i think). i really liked this cute yet angsty defense of decoration as a critical practice. i have experienced the knee-jerk reaction of just wanting to make pretty things and not think so hard goshdarnit, only to walk that sentiment back entirely as i argue in my head for the conceptual depth and rigor of prettyness haha. </p>

<p>related: <a href="https://4columns.org/kwon-sowon/with-pleasure" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">this review of the traveling exhibition, <em>with pleasure</em>, by sowon kwon at 4 columns</a>. i wish i had gotten to see this show!!! there is a beautiful catalogue you can buy or check out from your local art school library. this is a show of works from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_and_Decoration" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">the pattern &amp; decoration movement</a>, which has been a huge influence for me and lots of other artists i know. there is a lot to think about in these works, especially when it comes to conversations about modernism, cultural appropriation, and feminism. </p>

<p>faith ringgold was making quilts around the same time that the P&amp;D movement was happening, but i think she's usually associated with the feminist art movement instead? all these movements and labels are applied retroactively anyway, so take them with a massive grain of salt. anyway, her incredible quilts and paintings are on view at the new museum in new york right now, and ye olde new york times has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/17/arts/design/faith-ringgold-new-museum.html" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">a write up for you here</a>. if you don't know this work, get to know it!!!</p>

<p>another feminist named faith! faith wilding has new drawings at anat egbi gallery in los angeles, and rachel elizabeth jones <a href="https://contemporaryartreview.la/faith-wilding-at-anat-ebgi/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">wrote about them for contemporary art review l.a</a>. i was lucky enough to be in a zoom class that faith visited in 2020, and she was so much fun! these meditative images of "fossils" made me think of a review i read recently of a new book, sheila heti's <em>pure colour</em>. i just ordered it, anyone out there read it yet? i read that the main characters turn into leaves at one point...</p>

<p>how about another instagram post?? i really resisted instagram for a long time, and i still don't love it and sometimes suspend my account to get away, but all the artists and writers on there bring me back... <a href="https://variablewest.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">variable west </a>covers west-coast art and is one of the nicest things in my social media "feed." they have a newsletter you should sign up for; each show listing is paired with a reflection prompt to get your creative viewing energy flowing. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CaIOUExPqAV/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">this post features a recent response from a reader</a>. follow them for more in this series. thank you amelia and the VW crew!</p>

<p>i saw caitlin cherry's painting <em>her burnout</em> <em>tesseract </em>in<a href="https://4columns.org/d-souza-aruna/black-femme" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"> a review of the 2021 show black femme</a> at canada gallery. i immediately spaced on her name and the name of the show but i couldn't get the painting out of my head. i finally figured out where i saw it, and after a bit more reading i found <a href="https://032c.com/magazine/caitlin-cherry-coded-images" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">this interview with the artist </a>about issues surrounding technology, visual culture, and the complex representations of black femme bodies in her work. i'm also a big fan of <a href="https://www.instagram.com/studydark/?hl=en" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">dark study</a>, the alternative-mfa program that cherry runs. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.metalmagazine.eu/en/post/article/salman-toor" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><img alt="Screen Shot 2022-02-21 at 11.00.32 PM.png" src="https://buttondown.s3.amazonaws.com/images/9e95da06-2c1b-4ae9-9d14-c8241e4673cb.png"/></a></p>
<p>this show is a couple of years old now (!), but i still think about these paintings very often. read about <a href="https://www.metalmagazine.eu/en/post/article/salman-toor" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">salman toor's 2020 show at the whitney,</a> <em>how will i know</em>, in metal magazine, which is a publication i wasn't familiar with but it seems cool! but really though, these are such beautiful pictures, i hope i get to see them in person some day. </p>

<p>i'll wrap it up with <a href="https://www.maakemagazine.com/tyanna-buie" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">this interview </a>by the lovely sarah rose sharp with the amazing tyanna buie for maake magazine. i got to meet tyanna the other week when she visited the university of michigan (where i'm currently at), and am now officially a fan. tyanna's prints have so much depth in their layers and personal symbolism, and as a printmaking nerd i love the variety of processes she uses. if you ever get the chance to hear her talk about her work, do it! most fun i have ever had at an artist talk : )</p>
<p>ok that seems like a good amount of stuff. more soon! let me know if you see anything cool out there you'd like to share with me.</p>
<p>thanks!!! ---martha</p>
