<p>speaking of the art world, or as it's sometimes called the "arts community," <a href="https://contemporaryartreview.la/learn-from-this-community/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here is a great article about the use of the word community by artists</a>. i'm guessing we have all overused this word at some point, so it's cool to read this critical take on the potential and risks of community based arts.</p>
