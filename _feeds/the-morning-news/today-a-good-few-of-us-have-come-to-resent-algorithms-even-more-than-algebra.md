    <p>News to us? The roots of the word "algorithm" go back to the ninth century in modern-day Iran. <a href="https://www.openculture.com/2022/04/why-algorithms-are-called-algorithms.html">Via Open Culture</a>: </p>

<p><em>In making or influencing choices humans would once have handled themselves, algorithms do present a risk of &ldquo;de-skilling&rdquo; as we come to rely on their services. We all occasionally feel gratitude for the blessings those services send our way, just as we all occasionally blame them for our dissatisfactions &mdash; making the algorithm, in other words, into a thoroughly modern deity.</em></p>
