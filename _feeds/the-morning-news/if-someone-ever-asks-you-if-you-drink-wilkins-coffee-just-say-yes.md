    <p>Thanks to <a href="https://www.openculture.com/2022/11/jim-hensons-commercials-for-wilkins-coffee.html">Open Culture</a>, we now know Jim Henson made some pretty violent coffee commercials with puppets in the late 1950s. </p>

<p><em>Up until that time, TV advertisers typically made a direct sales pitch. &ldquo;We took a different approach,&rdquo; said Henson in Christopher Finch&rsquo;s Of Muppets and Men: The Making of the Muppet Show. &ldquo;We tried to sell things by making people laugh.&rdquo; The campaign for Wilkins Coffee was a hit. &ldquo;In terms of popularity of commercials in the Washington area,&rdquo; said Henson in a 1982 interview with Judy Harris, &ldquo;we were the number one, the most popular commercial.&rdquo; Henson&rsquo;s ad agency began marketing the idea to other regional coffee companies around the country. Henson re-shot the same spots with different brand names. &ldquo;I bought my contract from that agency,&rdquo; said Henson, &ldquo;and then I was producing them&ndash;the same things around the country. And so we had up to about a dozen or so clients going at the same time. At the point, I was making a lot of money.&rdquo;</em></p>
