    <p>From Tim Hunkin, co-creator of the TV series <em>The Secret Life of Machines, </em>a charming series of videos called "The Secret Life of Components."</p>

<p>Even if you don&#39;t really make things (we don&#39;t), the videos are full of interesting information on how simple things work, like springs or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDwdFmU6A_w&amp;list=PLtaR0lZhSyANYB0Xxb9OSp47pHuQmj3Ol&amp;index=8">glue</a>, or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZN0PBBzEHw&amp;list=PLtaR0lZhSyANYB0Xxb9OSp47pHuQmj3Ol&amp;index=2">chains</a>.</p>

<p><em>In the past, when people asked me how to learn practical skills, I&rsquo;ve told them they just have to make things badly to start with but to keep going and they will improve. I made things badly for the first half of my life. However, I now learn a lot from watching practical YouTube videos and realise that they can teach the sort of informal tips that used to be part of traditional apprenticeships. So I&rsquo;m delighted to be contributing to this wonderful new learning resource!</em></p>
