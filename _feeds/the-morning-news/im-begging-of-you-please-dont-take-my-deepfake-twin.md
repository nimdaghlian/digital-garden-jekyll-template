Holly+)"></iframe>
    <p>In yet more AI weirdness&mdash;which, we guess, is something we&#39;ll all be saying for the rest of our lives&mdash;here&#39;s a cover of "Jolene" by artist Holly Herndon&rsquo;s deepfake &ldquo;twin&rdquo; Holly+.</p>

<p>From <a href="https://pitchfork.com/news/holly-herndon-covers-dolly-parton-jolene-using-ai-listen/">Pitchfork</a>:</p>

<p><em>Holly Herndon has released a new cover of Dolly Parton&rsquo;s classic ballad &ldquo;Jolene,&rdquo; recorded with artificial intelligence. The AI cover was created with Herndon&rsquo;s deepfake &ldquo;twin&rdquo; Holly+, which allows other people to sing in the electronic composer&rsquo;s voice. In this instance, a modified score of &ldquo;Jolene,&rdquo; comprised of new harmonies, was fed to Holly+ and then generated in Herndon&rsquo;s voice. Accompanying the voice is Ryan Norris on guitar. </em></p>

<p><em>The track arrives with a new music video directed by the digital artist Sam Rolfes. For the visual, Rolfes used motion-capture technology to animate a 3D model of Herndon, which swivels around in a desk chair before standing up to sing. The entire performance takes place in a glitchy pastoral world filled with old trucks and farm houses.</em></p>
