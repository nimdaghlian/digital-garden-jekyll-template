    <p>For the moment when the interlocutor finally comes calling. From David Lehman&#39;s "Questions to Ask for a <em>Paris Review</em> Interview"</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do you have a favorite time of day? Favorite weather?<br />
Tell me about your writing process.<br />
Is that so? I would never have guessed.<br />
Do you ever think about abandoning writing altogether?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sorry but I have to ask you this.<br />
How is writing a novel like playing a game of chess?<br />
One critic called your last book a &ldquo;mess.&rdquo;<br />
What do you think of psychoanalysis?</p>

<p>You once told me that the greatest human subject is lust.<br />
Have you thought about how and where you&rsquo;d like to die?<br />
Certainly I can clarify.<br />
I don&#39;t mean now, but when you must.</p>
