    <p>Em Cooper&#39;s new video for the Beatles&#39; song "I&#39;m Only Sleeping" required her to make 1,300 separate oil paintings.</p>

<p>From an interview with Cooper on <a href="https://www.itsnicethat.com/news/em-cooper-danny-sangra-the-beatles-revolver-special-edition-animation-041122">It&#39;s Nice That</a>: "The song itself evokes such a mesmerising, languid, dreamy state, in a way my job was only to follow its lead with a paintbrush in my hand."</p>
